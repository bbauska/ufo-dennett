<p class="tallFirstLetter">A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature is one of the most shocking and 
mindboggling experiences a person can have. And it happens more often than you might 
think. There are many thousands of documented cases. Most people who have these kinds 
of encounters rarely report it to UFO groups, so the actual number is likely much 
higher. These cases have been occurring for at least a hundred years and probably much 
longer. They occur all over the world to all kinds of people. This episode presents six 
particularly unusual cases. In each of these cases, the witnesses not only held 
conversations with the ETs, but they were given information that impacted them for the 
rest of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ALIEN PLAN</span>. One evening in April 1962, five-year-old Worthington White woke up in his 
grandmother’s home in Quantico, Virginia to see light flooding into his bedroom through 
the attic door. He noticed three short child-like figures standing in the room. One of 
them approached and began to communicate telepathically, downloading information into 
his brain. The next morning, he knew his life would never be the same. In fact, he had 
incredibly ambitious goals and a whole new plan for his life. Growing up, he faced many 
challenges, but the advice given to him by the ETs appeared in his mind and helped chart 
the course of his life, eventually putting him in an incredibly influential career at 
the very top of the US government.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A GRAY SAT NEXT TO ME</span>. One night in June 1963, seventeen-year-old Victor was driving 
along a remote road in Deptford, New Jersey. Without warning, his headlights failed, 
his car engine quit, and he rolled to a stop. A sudden inexplicable and overwhelming 
fear swept through him and he realized someone was sitting next to him in his car. 
Looking over, he was shocked to see a short gray alien. It looked at him with such 
peace that he became instantly calm. In then communicating him with telepathically, 
filling his mind with volumes of information. It then disappeared, but from that 
point on, Victor slowly discovered that the gray had taught him many things.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE RAINBOW MAN</span>. One afternoon in summer 1974, two brothers, Thomas (age 5) and Kevin 
(age 4) from Needmore, Pennsylvania, noticed a hippy-looking man sit down in their 
backyard. The man began to communicate to them telepathically. Both boys noticed the 
man had a visible aura filled with rainbow colors. The man shared knowledge with them 
about themselves and the universe, taking them on an interactive journey into some of 
Earth’s natural wonders, and teaching them both about their past, present and future 
life. Both were deeply impacted by the encounter and found that the knowledge the man 
shared with them helped to guide them throughout their adult life.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I WAS SO SCARED, I STARTED TO CRY</span>. One night in summer 1988, a young boy, Jose de Diego 
Vazquez, was walking through the Yunque Rain Forest in Puerto Rico as part of a survival 
training course. Strange lights flew overhead and landed behind a large rock. Jose was 
petrified with fear when a male humanoid stepped out and began to speak with him, 
telling him not to be afraid. The figure then used strange symbols to share astounding 
information with the young boy. The man disappeared, and Jose ran back to camp only to 
be faced with a strange mystery. No time had passed during the entire encounter!</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE BLOOD OF THE KINGS</span>. On the night of January 10, 2010, a man heard a strange knocking 
sound on his back door in Toledo Ohio. Going to investigate, he was met by a short gray 
alien. The man invited the gray inside, at which point, a long conversation followed. 
The gray saud they had observed the man since childhood, that they were very interested 
in his genetics, and then proceeded to answer all the witness’s questions, even allowing 
the witness to touch the ET. The ET had some questions of his own. It was an encounter 
that would change the witness’s life.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE HARVESTERS OF MEMORIES</span>. Ever since he was a young boy, Christopher, a boy from South 
Dakota, had been visited by gray ETs. Usually they stood by his bed and seemed to study 
him. The visits occurred at least twice a year, but doubled when Christopher (who was 
being treated for Aspergers and depression) decided to stop taking prescription medicine. 
Christopher suddenly excelled physically, mentally and creatively. Then, on the night 
of February 26, 2015, he was visited by an 8-foot-tall elder gray who spoke to him 
telepathically, sharing incredible volumes of information about the ETs and their 
mission on Earth, and explained exactly why they found him to be of particular interest 
to them.</p>

<p>These six cases are important because they show that often an encounter with a humanoid 
appears to be an intentional event designed to impart wisdom to an individual to help 
guide them through their lives. They show that extraterrestrial contact can play a very 
powerful role in a person’s life-path.</p>

ONBOARD AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT:<br>
FIVE FANTASTIC FIRSTHAND CASES</a>.</h4>
<!-- <span class="seeDate">August 8, 2025</span>  -->
<h5>44,502 views  Aug 8, 2025</h5>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">It is the closest of all UFO experiences: being taken onboard a craft. Cases like these 
represent the frontline of research. They contain more information than any other type 
of UFO encounter and offer the opportunity to answer the many questions that surround 
extraterrestrial contact, such as, who are these mysterious visitors to our planet, 
where do they come from, and why they are here. While some people remain skeptical that 
cases like these take place, the truth is that there are tens of thousands of reports, 
with indications that they may number in the millions. This video presents five 
particularly extensive and lesser-known onboard UFO encounters from across the world-
-cases which involve long interactions and conversations with extraterrestrials. Most 
of the cases involve multiple witnesses, each of who were given amazing information 
about the ETs and/or the future of our planet.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I HAVE NO FEAR</span>. On the night of February 4, 1974, a family of three was camping in a 
remote and isolated area of the vast Sonoran Desert in Mexico. In the middle of the 
night, they were awakened by a beeping noise but couldn’t locate the source. The next 
morning, the mother had the impression that a UFO had visited them in the night. Years 
passed, and they decided to explore the incident under hypnosis. Together, they recalled 
being taken onboard the craft by gray-type ETs. The father was given harrowing 
predictions about the future of humanity. The son recalled being shown strange alien 
symbols. The mother could only recall being led up to the craft. All four say that the 
strange encounter remains one of the most mysterious events of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I HAD A ROLE TO PLAY</span>. One night in June of 1975, a newly engaged couple were in Minong, 
Pennsylvania when they saw a UFO and experienced a period of missing time. They alerted 
their family who also saw the object. They flashed a light at it, and it flashed back 
and disappeared. Later, the couple realized that they had missing time and went under 
hypnosis. The woman recalled being taken onboard and meeting a glowing being face-to-face. 
He told her that the world was on the verge of catastrophe, and that she had a role to 
play in helping humanity. The man recalled only that the ETs were concerned for the 
world. Both say the encounter was benevolent.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">MY WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED</span>. In 1975, Frank Johnson of eastern Pennsylvania 
began meditating in the hopes of making contact with ETs. Immediately, he and his wife 
Alice experienced a series of close-up sightings outside their home. Then, one evening, 
the room lit up and the couple saw a UFO outside. The went outside and were suddenly 
pulled onboard the craft. They saw three human-looking figures in blue jumpsuits. The 
two were separated. The woman was given a physical exam and healed of a chronic 
medical condition. The husband held a long telepathic conversation with the ETs about 
astronomy, other dimensions and humanity. The two were then returned to their home. 
Later the woman had another missing time encounter.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">OUR MISSION IS ONE OF PEACE</span>. On the night of January 28, 1978, a man was hiking near Lago 
Vichuquen, Chile when a massive saucer-shaped craft appeared overhead, struck him with a 
beam of light and pulled him into the craft. He was greeted by three human-looking 
figures wearing tan-jumpsuits. Frightened at first, the witness calmed down as the ETs 
explained that they just wanted to speak with him. A very long conversation ensued, 
during which the ETs answered all the man’s questions and offered volumes of information 
about themselves and the history and future of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A PURE LEARNING EXPERIENCE</span>. At 2am on July 1, 1996, two men were driving near Coates, 
Minnesota when they heard a loud buzzing noise, and saw a glowing craft alongside the 
road. They stopped the car. One of the witnesses exited the car to take a closer look. 
The next thing they knew, hours had passed, they were approaching the next town, and 
it was morning. Later one of the witnesses went under hypnosis. He recalled being 
struck by a blue beam of light and pulled into the craft. He was greeted by two grays 
and a human-looking man. The ETs said that they had brought him onboard to teach him. 
The witness was shown many things and was told that he was part of their “plan” with 
humanity.</p>

<p>The importance of cases like these cannot be understated. The witnesses themselves have 
been deeply changed by their experiences, and the information they have been told 
firsthand by the ETs themselves has profound consequences for all humanity. the five 
cases presented here are just a tiny fraction of the true number of cases. The witnesses 
don’t have the luxury of disbelief. The question is not, are these cases taking place. 
The evidence speaks for itself. The question is, will humanity heed the advice given 
by the ETs?</p>
